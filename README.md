# Smart-time-management-lamp
We did a project that manages your time. When the ultrasonic sensor detects the motion of an object located closer than 20 centimeters after 4 seconds to eliminate false positives, Arduino includes a lamp. It is on 30 minutes when 30 minutes pass the lamp is switched off for 15 minutes, and this is repeated until the power is supplied.
